Hi! Thank you for downloading the Autodemo ReDMountain mod for SADX PC/Steam. This mod was made by one of the guys who brought you the Autodemo Windy Valley mod and Autodemo Speed Highway mod. The differences between the final version of Red Mountain and the Autodemo version may not be immediately noticeable, so I've compiled a list of differences I saw when porting the level over that you can use to guide you to the individual differences.

Objects
-------

-The bridges in the level use a redder texture than what's used in the final game.
-The jailed ghosts in Act 2 have a unique texture for their shoes that was completely removed from the final game, and their shoes were made pitch black instead.
-The spiked ball on the jailed ghosts uses a different texture around the spikes.
-The zipline machine uses different textures for the bottom pieces.
-The animations for the zipline machines are slightly different.
-The Fireballs that erupt out of the ground now have an animation that uses otherwise unused textures. This is difficult to see in normal gameplay, so pause if you want to see it clearly.
-A ghost enemy was removed completely from the final game. In this mod, its model, textures, and animations are not custom, but its coding and behavior are. It had no coding in the Autodemo.
-A smaller, different hammer object is present in the Autodemo's files (and was removed completely in the final game), but has no coding. Its models have been recycled in a new, custom object present in Knuckles's layout in the "Complete Mode" layouts.
-The green fences placed in Sonic's layouts were placed with a bigger fence model in mind. This bigger version of the fence is present in the Autodemo (and was removed completely in the final game), but has no coding. By default, when playing the level as Sonic, the green fences will use this model. Their collision has been adjusted accordingly.

Level
-----
-Acts 1 and 3 use a texture that uses alpha near the end of the long, spiral, green metal path, which was changed to a different, opaque texture in the final game.
-Act 2 uses different textures for the support beams in front of the jail cell that has 3 jailed ghosts in a row.
-The clouds present in Act 3 are lower than they are in the final.
(All of these changes are, oddly, present in SADX's level geometry for this level.)


Music
-----
-The music for Act 1 and Act 3 is slightly different at the end of the song.
-Act 2's music is longer, almost matching the length of the OST version.


Extra
-----
-Four cheat codes have been provided:
	-Press and hold X while the level loads to make the small boxes with yellow lights on them use a green texture instead, very similar to what was seen in a single, prerelease screenshot of the level.
	-Press and hold Y while the level loads to make the small light machines in Act 2 not ignore lighting, like they appeared in the unveiling footage.
	-Press and hold R while the level loads to add an additional cloud layer to the level. This cloud layer uses an unused model in both the final and the Autodemo that also uses a unique texture.
	-Press and hold L while the level loads to disable the use of the larger, unused green fence model for Sonic's layouts.
	(All of these cheats can be activated and can be active at the same time.)
